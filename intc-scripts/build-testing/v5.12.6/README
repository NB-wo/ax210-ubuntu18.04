In order to verify stack dev build integrity,
we need to build it against a list of tags of the kernel.

this will be done by the Jenkins Linux build.
we will supply the info needed by the Jenkins build,
via files and folders under this build-testing folder.

each folder will include 2 files, a config file and revisions.info file.
the config file will hold the kernel configuration file to use,
and revisions.info will include the kernel tag, and iwlwifi config file
name to use.

The Jenkins job will iterate on the folders
and we will build stack-dev tree, according to the info in
revisions.info file

for example (v5.12.6):
intc-scripts/build-testing
	|- v5.12.6
		|- config
		|- revisions.info

please note:
1 - the files names must be - config & revisions.info in each
folder. the folder name can by anything.
2 - the info in revisions.info soould be as follows:
	KERNEL_GIT_REVISION=<tag in the kernel tree>
	WLWIFI_DEFCONFIG=<iwlwifi def config name>
3 - for now the kernel to be used will be:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
this will move to git-jer-8/iwlwifi-kernel after it will include all
needed tags.
