## <component>: <subcomponent>: subject
## component is usually iwlwifi/mac80211/cfg80211 and similar
## subcomponent is something within, like rs, bt-coex, ...
## need [BUGFIX] prefix for type=bug
##
## Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not
## "Fixed bug" or "Fixing bug". This makes more sense when reading
## the commit message before the code change, which is usually true
## for everyone but yourself. Also, it matches the convention of
## automated commit messages like from merge and revert.
##
## In the body of the commit message (that goes here) answer the
## following questions:
##  - why is this change necessary
##  - high-level overview of how the patch achieves the objective
##  - what are possible side-effects of the change
##
## Remember that most commit messages will eventually be public, so
##  - don't use code-names ("Stone Peak")
##  - don't refer to thinks we can't publish (WAPI, ...), if you
##    must do it after a --- separator below
##
## uncomment and adjust the metadata lines below as appropriate
##
## maint is only for chromeos, the scripting etc.
## bug/fixes is only needed for bugfixes
