config IWLXVT
	tristate "Enable XVT op_mode"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	select IWLWIFI_DEVICE_TESTMODE
	select IWLWIFI_SUPPORT_DEBUG_OVERRIDES
	help
	  This option enables the xVT operation mode. xVT mode supports
	  special debug and testing operations that are not supported in
	  the standard operation modes, and is used for verification
	  purposes.
	  xVT mode does not support the standard WiFi operations, and
	  does not communicate with the user mode through the nl80211.

	  Enabling this options allows to fully control the HW using
	  an external tool in user space.

	  Say Y if you have the user space application and want
	  to execute debug and testing flows on the HW.

config IWLMVM_P2P_OPPPS_TEST_WA

	---help---
	  This option enables a WA to pass P2P OPPPS certification test.
	  This test verifies P2P client power management behavior when
	  connected to P2P GO that advertises OPPPS. Since P2P client power
	  management is not supported currently by FW a special WA is required.
	  Send zeroed quota on P2P client MAC if power save is enabled from
	  user space to mimic power management behavior. Update quota to normal
	  value otherwise.
